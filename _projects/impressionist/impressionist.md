A canvas painted in the color of green which could also be referred to as 'Pantone color of the year' (2017), 'a green screen’, or ‘a container for anything’. Rather than an artistic style of painting, in today’s context, impression refers to a measurement by which audience is quantified for its engagement to a digital content.

Equipped with a face-detecting camera, the painting adopts this emerging definition for ‘impression’ to assign it's own value. Accordingly, the artwork speculates; What cultural values remain and what new behaviours emerge at the horizon of digital impressionism itself.

Originally created at FABRICA Research Centre, 2017 for ‘I See Colors Everywhere’ exhibition, Triennale Design Museum.
