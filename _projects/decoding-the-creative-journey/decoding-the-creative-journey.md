[Into the Wild: Decoding the Creative Journey](http://mv.works/about/into-the-wild/) by MW Works was an event and exhibition at [Somerset House](https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/) in London investigating the underlying creative process behind 10 different various project from 10 different artists.

I was invited by curator [Estela Oliva](https://www.estelaoliva.com/) to collaborate on the creation of a 3D visualization piece reflecting the how the participating artists valued different elements within their creative process behind their work.
