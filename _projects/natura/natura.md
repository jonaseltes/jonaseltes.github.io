Inspired by the nature of the my own conversations with Italians during my residency at FABRICA Research Centre, "Lost in Computation" embodies a realtime multilingual conversation between a Swedish and an Italian-speaking chatbot, translated through Google Translate.

The conversation highlights the level of sophistication machine-learning algorithms have achieved thus reflecting how the abstraction of numerous layers of hidden computation fragments our communication in today's digital landscape, both on logical as well as cultural level.

Originally created for FABRICA Research Centreâ€™s celebration of UN International Mother Language Day 2017.
