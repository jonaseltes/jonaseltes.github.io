A cultural & educational interactive installation inviting people to learn about the world of Internet of Things in a playful way.

Each screen offers a view of the world around us including home, environment, DIY, body & mind, culture and social, where objects (circles) can be linked to data sources (squares) and purposes (triangles) to further explore IoT projects within each category.
