Imago Mundi is the collection of works commissioned and collected by Luciano Benetton on his travels around the world, involving, established and emerging artists from many different countries. Each of them has created a work whose only restriction is its 10x12 cm format, contributing to the creation of a remarkable artistic geography.

The collection currently holds a total number of 25,000+ canvases and are all manually photographed and catalogued digitally. In the occasion of the opening of a new museum dedicated to the collection of Imago Mundi, FABRICA was comissioned to propose new works offering a unique perspective on the colleciton.

The Imago Mundi Window installation proposed an augumented view on the collection with blank canvases covering surrounding walls only experienced through the layer of a screen embodying the digital representation of the collection in a browser window reflecting on the increasingly fragmented view of the world as a product of digital consumtion and algorithmical curation of art.
