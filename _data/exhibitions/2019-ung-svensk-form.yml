The project was created with the aim of increasing the knowledge and widening the scope of new, innovative Swedish design; helping it reach new audiences. The exhibition offers designers a possibility to meet the audience and manufacturers, a chance to initiate dialogue and establish new contacts. The project was initiated by Svensk Form and Form/Design Center in 1998. Ung Svensk Form is organised by Svensk Form (The Swedish Society of Crafts and Design) in cooperation with IKEA, the City of Malm√∂ and ArkDes.
